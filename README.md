# Welcome to my Personal website repository!

This is a space where I am looking to create a web portfolio<br />
containing my growth in the technology space, accomplishments, <br/>
aspirations.<br/> 

## Goals:
-  Base Page:
    1. Header (My Name, link tree to: home, linkedIn, Resume) 
    2. Footer (link to repo, contact me, made by, feedback)
    

- Homepage:
    1. Short about section on my existence.
    2. Section on my professional growth
    3. Horizontal scroll of projects (initial spins to show <br /> all of them)
    4. Link to Resume / Projects
    4. Professional goals for 5, 10 years
    5. Learn more about me section
    	- Hobbies section
        - Planning (lock behind 2 factor Auth)
    
- Resume/Project page:
    1. Horizontal reel with larger summary of projects and <br/>
	links to repos

### Example of my learnings:<br/>
#### Interviewing:<br/>
- **General questions**  read up on about sections, for personal <br />
questions make a doc have those questions and answers review them. <br />
Add to with time and each new question.

- **Technical questions** do:
	- Get better at just talking to yourself as you solve <br />
		leetcode problems or make a list of observations you <br />
		make as you read the description.
	- Leet code go through the best sorting algo, search algo, DFS, BFS. 
	- Learn datatypes of you language. 
	- Learn different examples of Time and space complexity.
